Welcome to the DSA Revision Quiz App repository! This Python application, built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and basic Flask integration to link HTML pages with the Tkinter GUI, is designed to facilitate daily revision of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The quiz app randomly generates 5 questions from a bank of DSA problems, providing users with an engaging and dynamic learning experience. At the end of the quiz, the app provides a detailed score and analysis of the user's performance, helping B.Tech students track their progress and focus on areas that need improvement. With the belief that consistent revision is crucial for mastering DSA, this quiz app aims to make daily revision a convenient and beneficial practice for students pursuing a Bachelor's degree in technology.
